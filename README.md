RaspiCam OpenCV Readme

Note: It's assumed that you have the OpenMax API and OpenCV installed on your RPi

This software is designed to give normal opencv functionality to the RPi camera that connects to the CSI port.  This is done by modifying the original RaspiVid source code and including the OpenCV directories.

Yeah this Readme will need to be improved =P
